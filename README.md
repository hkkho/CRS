# CANDU Refuelling Game

This repository is the source for the web-first CANDU on-power refuelling game
deployed from `web/candu-playtest` to Vercel.

The player keeps a deterministic practice reactor at useful power, manages RRS
reserve, spends a finite fresh-bundle inventory, refuels channels, and builds
score from stable operation and useful discharged burnup. Operations and Core
Designer share one authoritative `GameSession`; the browser never substitutes
a second simulator when the WASM bridge is unavailable.

## Product architecture

The active product path is intentionally narrow:

```text
Phaser/Vite web client
        |
TypeScript protocol + Web Worker
        |
ReactorSim.BrowserHost (browser-wasm)
        |
ReactorSim.Browser
        |
ReactorSim.Game
        |
ReactorSim.Core
```

- `web/candu-playtest` owns the Phaser UI, browser protocol, worker transport,
  smoke test, and deployed reproduction benchmark.
- `src/ReactorSim.BrowserHost` publishes the .NET browser-WASM host.
- `src/ReactorSim.Browser` owns the versioned bridge contract.
- `src/ReactorSim.Game` owns the reusable run/session and presentation
  snapshots.
- `src/ReactorSim.Core` owns deterministic reactor state, refuelling,
  inventory, burnup, controls, and the spatial solver.
- `data`, `reference`, `docs`, and the retained solver benchmark/tooling
  support the shared simulation and its provenance; they are not alternate
  playable products.

The exact active two-group equations are documented in
[`docs/physics/active-two-group-solver.md`](docs/physics/active-two-group-solver.md).
The current product contract is
[`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md), and the active
work plan is [`docs/WEB_ROADMAP.md`](docs/WEB_ROADMAP.md).

## Local development

Stage the authoritative browser bridge from the repository root:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/Build-BrowserWasm.ps1
```

Then run the web app:

```powershell
cd web/candu-playtest
npm ci
npm run dev
```

For a production-shaped local build:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/Build-BrowserWasm.ps1
cd web/candu-playtest
npm ci
npm test
npm run build
```

Generated WASM is staged into `web/candu-playtest/public/wasm` and is ignored
except for the directory placeholder.

## Tests

Run the shared .NET tests that protect the web runtime:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/Test-DotNet.ps1
```

Run the browser-focused .NET, Vitest, and production-build checks:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/Test-Browser.ps1
```

The browser package also exposes:

```text
npm run smoke
npm run benchmark -- --label=local --warm-samples=1
```

The deployed acceptance path is the stable Vercel alias. The production workflow
builds the .NET AOT WASM bridge, verifies the staged bridge, runs frontend
tests/builds, deploys the prebuilt Vercel output, then performs smoke and
reproduction-matrix checks against the stable deployment.

## Scope

The repository is for the web CANDU game and the shared simulation required to
run and validate it. Separate presentation clients, headless gameplay products,
and archived duplicate test trees are intentionally excluded.

Shutdown, scram, accident progression, operator-training scenarios, full plant
operations, and plant-grade safety claims remain out of scope.
